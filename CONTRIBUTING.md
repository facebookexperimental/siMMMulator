# Contributing to siMMMulator

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process

We built the first version of siMMMulator internally but have decided to release the code to the public because of its unique value to help marketers validate their models. With the next phase of this project, we're hoping to collaborate with those in the industry to add additional features, get feedback on what could be improved, and work together to validate measurement models.
