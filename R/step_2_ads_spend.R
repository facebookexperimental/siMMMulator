#' Step 2: Generate Ad Spend
#'
#' Simulates how much to spend on each ad campaign and channel
#'
#' @param campaign_spend_mean A numeric, the average amount of money spent on a campaign, must be in same currency as baseline sales generated in step 1
#' @param campaign_spend_std A numeric, the standard deviation of money spent on a campaign, must be in same currency as baseline sales generated in step 1
#' @param max_min_proportion_on_each_channel A vector of numerics specifying the minimum and maximum percentages of total spend allocated to each channel, should be in the same order as channels specified (channels that use impressions first followed by channels that use clicks), length should be 2 times (number of total channels - 1)
