#' Step 0 : Define Basic Parameters
#'
#' User inputs basic parameters that will be used in subsequent steps to simulate the data set, exists so that user does not have to keep inputting them. The parameters here initialize some variables in the user's environment.
#'
#' @param years A number, number of years you want to generate weekly data for. Must be a whole number and equal to or greater than 1.
#' @param channels_impressions A vector of character strings, names of media channels that use impressions as their metric of activity (Examples: Facebook, TV, Long-Form Video), must be in vector format with strings
#' @param channels_clicks A vector of character strings, names of media channels that use clicks as their metric of activity (Examples: Search), must be in vector format with strings
#' @param frequency_of_campaigns A number, how often campaigns occur (for example, frequency of 2 would yield a new campaign every 2 weeks with each campaign lasting 2 weeks). Must be a whole number greater than or equal to 1.
#' @param true_cvr A vector of numbers, what the underlying conversion rates of all the channels are, statistical noise will be added on top of this, should be a vector of numbers between 0 and 1 in the SAME order as how channels were specified (channels that use impressions first, followed by channels that use clicks), must have same length as number of channels
#' @param revenue_per_conv A number, How much money we make from a conversion (i.e. profit from a unit of sale). Must be a number greater than 0.
#'
#' @return A list (in users' global environment) of variables the user has input
#' @export
#'
