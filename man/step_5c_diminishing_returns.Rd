\title{Step 5c: Applying Diminishing Returns to Media Variables}
\usage{
step_5c_diminishing_returns(
  alpha_saturation,
  gamma_saturation,
  x_marginal = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha_saturation}{A vector of numbers specifying alpha parameter of geometric distribution for applying diminishing returns to media variables. Should be in the same order as how the media channels were specified (first with the channels that use impressions as a metric of activity and then channels that use clicks), must have same length as number of total channels}

\item{gamma_saturation}{A vector of numbers between 0 and 1 specifying gamma parameter of geometric distribution for applying diminishing returns to media variables. MUST have elements between 0 and 1!!!! Should be in the same order as how the media channels were specified (first with the channels that use impressions as a metric of activity and then channels that use clicks), must have same length as number of total channels.}

\item{x_marginal}{Numeric. When provided, the function returns the Hill-transformed value of the x_marginal input. Default is to leave NULL}
}
\value{
A data frame with media variables that exhibit diminishing returns
}
\description{
Apply diminishing returns to our media variables
